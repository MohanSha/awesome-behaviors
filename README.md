# Awesome (Product Management) Behaviors

The following list is collected from my library of product management best practices, tips, how-tos, and case studies.

Some links (only a few) include a list of bullet points from the article. I expect this feature to be included in the future.

Behavioral topics have considerable overlap. I expect to revise these categories based on your feedback.

Please see my [main repository](https://github.com/bjpcjp/awesome-product-management) for additional material. Thank you!
