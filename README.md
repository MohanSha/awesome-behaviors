# Awesome (Product Management) Behaviors

The following list is collected from my library of product management best practices, tips, how-tos, and case studies. The first release is restricted to behavioral topics; future releases will expand this doc to include more technical topics.

Some links (only a few) include a list of bullet points from the article. I expect this feature to be included in the future.

Behavioral topics have considerable overlap. I expect to revise these categories based on your feedback.

Enjoy!
